# Problem Statement: Remove Background from Image using Python

## Objective
Develop a Python program that removes the background from an image and produces a clear foreground image with no additional pixels.

## Rules

### 1. Functionality
- The program should accurately remove the background from the provided images.
- The resulting image should have a clear foreground with no additional pixels or noise.

### 2. Input and Output
- The program should accept an image file as input (common formats such as JPEG, PNG).
- The output should be the foreground image with the background removed, saved in the same format as the input.

### 3. Libraries and Tools
- Participants are allowed to use any Python libraries and tools, such as OpenCV, PIL, or other relevant libraries, as long as they are free to use and properly documented in the submission.

### 4. Code Quality
- The code should be well-documented.
- The solution should be efficient and optimized for performance.

### 5. Submission
- Participants must submit their code, along with a brief README file explaining how to run the program and any dependencies required.
- A sample set of images will be provided for testing, and the output images should be included in the submission.
- Whenever you start to build the project, you have to add Mindstormsoftâ€™s GitHub ID as a collaborator for code evaluations.

### 6. Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy of background removal.
- Clarity of the resulting image (no additional pixels).
- Code quality and documentation.
- Efficiency and performance of the solution.

### 7. Execution Time
- The program must produce the resulting image within 3 minutes or less.

### 8. Program Enhancement
- Enhance your program using AI tools or libraries, ensuring the program runs offline without using any API keys or online services.

## Final Notes
Ensure all code submissions are well-documented and include a README file with clear instructions on running the program and any dependencies required.

Sample images will be provided, and the output images must be included in the submission.

Focus on optimizing the performance of your solution to ensure the resulting image is produced within the specified time frame.

Good luck to all participants!
